🚀 Deploying Website on EC2: Ansible Playbook, Docker, and Jenkins CI/CD 🚀

Thrilled to share insights into my latest project: deploying a website on an EC2 instance with a streamlined CI/CD pipeline using Ansible, Docker, and Jenkins! 🌐



Project Highlights:



1-Docker Commands for Dynamic Image Creation:

- Leveraged Docker commands within the Ansible playbook for dynamic image creation.

- Ensured that a new Docker image is generated in every successful Jenkins job, promoting consistency and traceability.



2- Dockerizing the Application:

- Crafted Dockerfiles to encapsulate the application's environment and dependencies.

- Employed Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications and simplifying deployment.



3- Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline:

-Established a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for end-to-end automation.

- Orchestrated the entire process, from building the Docker image to deploying the application on the EC2 instance.



Key Benefits:

1- Efficient Infrastructure Management: Ansible streamlined the EC2 instance setup and configuration.



2- Dynamic Image Creation: Docker commands within Jenkins jobs ensured a new image with each successful build.



3- Containerization with Docker: Ensured application isolation, scalability, and simplified deployment.



4- Continuous Integration: Jenkins automated the integration of code changes, enhancing collaboration.



5- Continuous Deployment: Achieved continuous and reliable application deployment with Jenkins.
